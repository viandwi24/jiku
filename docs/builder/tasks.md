## Backlog

### Plan 21 follow-ups (post-ship)
- [ ] Plugin adapter registration: expose `ctx.agent.registerAdapter()` via `StudioContributes` + `context-extender.ts` when the first plugin-authored adapter lands.
- [ ] Optional "retry phase 2 once on dropped tool" mode for HarnessAgentAdapter (residual risk: GPT sometimes drops a tool call with `tool_choice=auto` → loop exits early). Make opt-in because retry wastes a call when model genuinely decided to stop.
- [ ] Fix `plugin-permissions` loader UUID error: `caller.user_id === 'system'` (heartbeat/cron path) hits `project_memberships.user_id` (uuid column) and throws `invalid input syntax for type uuid: "system"`. Pre-existing; spammy log, non-blocking. Early-return before the query if `user_id` isn't a UUID.
- [ ] Harness iteration pill in UI (we emit `jiku-harness-iteration` events from iter ≥ 2; nothing consumes them yet).

### Plan 20 follow-ups (post-ship)
- [ ] Stale CamoFox tab recovery: if CamoFox evicts a cached tabId (idle timeout or `MAX_TABS_PER_SESSION` eviction), adapter should detect 404 on next call + refresh. Currently adapter caches `tabId` forever.
- [ ] Extend action registry to `JikuBrowserVercelAdapter` if any CDP-specific custom actions emerge (none today).
- [ ] Private registry publish for `jiku-camofox` image so deploys don't rebuild from git each time.

### Plan 19 follow-ups
- [ ] Sandboxed `skill_exec_file` runtime (separate plan — needs JS/TS/Python sandbox)
- [ ] Private-repo skill import via GitHub PAT (credentials vault integration)
- [ ] Expose per-phase credential/model override in Dreaming UI (schema already supports)
- [ ] Skill marketplace browse — catalog from skills.sh inside app
- [ ] Per-caller permission grant surface so `requires.permissions` in manifests actually gates at runtime (currently `grantedPermissions` passed as empty Set)
- [ ] `skill.source_changed` audit event emission on plugin activate/deactivate (currently reserved, not emitted)
- [ ] Dreaming effectiveness benchmark at 10k-memory scale
- [ ] Usage page: `agent_id=null` filter (background-only view)
- [ ] Memory browser: add `source_type` column to the table (currently only shown via Type badge tooltip)

### Plan 17 follow-ups
- [ ] Third-party plugin sandboxing (iframe origin isolation, code signing, per-publisher keys, bundle SRI) — deferred from original Plan 18 scope; current Plan 18 implements per-user permission grants but not iframe isolation
- [ ] Wire `ctx.files.*` to filesystem service (currently stubbed — returns empty)
- [ ] Wire `ctx.secrets.*` to credentials vault (currently throws)
- [ ] Implement `ctx.api.stream` (SSE streaming from plugin server to UI)
- [ ] Client-side `ctx.events.on` subscription (EventSource with query-string token similar to signed-URL flow)
- [ ] `ctx.ui.openModal` / `global.modal` slot host
- [ ] Rate-limit per plugin × user (complement to per-IP limiter on asset router)
- [ ] Bundle-size budget enforcement (warn on > 50KB, error on > 200KB gzipped)
- [ ] axe-core a11y CI check for plugin slot variations
- [ ] Add `jiku plugin reload <id> --project <p>` CLI command (needs server-side invalidate endpoint)
- [ ] Migrate `jiku.skills` / `jiku.social` to contribute UI entries (pattern now trivial)

### jiku.sheet follow-ups
- [ ] Verify `sheet_read` path-based read with projectId from `toolCtx.runtime['project_id']` works correctly end-to-end in production (dynamic import path from plugin to server filesystem service)

### Other
- [ ] Cron Task System nice-to-haves (schedule_paused state, timezone support, run history pagination)
- [ ] Verify Telegram bot responds end-to-end after `depends: [StudioPlugin]` switch (test: send message → typing indicator → get_datetime tool call → MarkdownV2 response)
- [ ] DB migration: `cd apps/studio/db && bun run db:push` — applies Plan 17 migration plus any previously pending (filesystem, attachments, persona_prompt)
- [ ] Update `apps/studio/web` to import from `@jiku/ui` instead of local `@/components/ui/` and `@/components/ai-elements/`
- [ ] Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to web `.env.local` (WS_URL no longer needed)
- [ ] Test suite — unit tests for resolveScope, checkAccess, PluginLoader, resolveCaller, `discoverPluginsFromFolder`, `signAsset` / `verifyAsset`
- [ ] Invite member feature (currently only owner can be member)
- [ ] Agent Tools tab — currently placeholder "coming soon", needs real tool assignment UI
- [ ] `extractPersonaPostRun()` — auto-extract persona signals after conversation (implemented but needs keyword tuning)
- [ ] Filesystem: add RustFS service to docker-compose.yml and set up default credentials for dev
